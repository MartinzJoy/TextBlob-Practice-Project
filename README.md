# TextBlob-Practice-Project
This project was just for practice purposes. It's a simple python Machine Learning project that use TextBlob(which uses the NLTK library) library to analyze text.

What's happening in the project:
There are several .txt files in the project that contain the SONA speeches from six South African presidents since 1990.
  SONA stands for State Of the Nation.
  This is a speech made by the president at least once a year to address the nation on the state of the country in general and plans for the  future
  
This project analyses the text in the .txt file and then give stats about the sentiments of the speech itself, as well as the objectivity(or subjectivity) of the speech.

This is just for fun. So you can download and play around with different speeches(You can do this by changing the filenames to which ever speech you desire to analyse on line 6 of the project file(TextBlob Practice Project.py). You'll understand what I mean when you read the file itself.)
